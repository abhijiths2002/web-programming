    <p>We believe that facilitating the recruitment process is as significant as opening the door to the students into the college. The college has a Career Guidance and Placement Cell (CGPC) functioning actively. The CGPC is headed by a Professor who coordinates all the activities under CGPC. Training Cell, Placement Cell and Entrepreneurship Development Cell are functioning under CGPC. The CGPC activities are coordinated by an Executive Committee headed by the Principal and consisting of Placement coordinator, Staff members (representing each department) and student representatives (one student representing each branch). Training and Placement Cell is an integral part of the Institute. The Institute has provided complete infrastructure for effective functioning of the Cell. Training activities are organized throughout the year in an effort towards preparing the prospective students for the campus selection programmes. The Cell invites various industries and reputed firms for campus recruitment. The Cell is sensitized to function all through the year towards generating placement and training opportunities for the students. The CGPC is committed to provide all possible support to its students in their efforts to find employment. The activity of CGPC starts with the preparation of the data bank of fifth semester students which will be updated thereafter. The detailed brochure of the institution prepared by CGPC is sent to reputed companies inviting them to the college for campus recruitment. The method of recruitment will be decided on receiving the suggestion from the respective companies, whether to host a combined recruitment drive or to organize the recruitment exclusively for MCET. Depending on the eligibility criteria listed out by the company, students are shortlisted from the MCET student data bank. The arrangements associated with the recruitment like venue arrangement, student registration, food, accommodation, transportation, conduct of tests, invigilation, valuation etc are done by the executive committee members assisted by student representatives and MCET staff. CGPC Auditorium (300 seat capacity), Hall (100 seat capacity) and Conference Hall are available.</p>
